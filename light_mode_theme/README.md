  	<h1>Adjust CSS Theme according to daylight</h1>
  	<p>
  	   Writting handlers to change the theme of every single element through DOM seems like too much of a trouble, I prefer this simple adjustment.

    <h3>TODO: </h3>
  	<ul>
    <li>Adjust according to month (winter is darker sooner than summer)
    <li>Adjust according to Geolocation (although I am not planning to apply it on my website, since I don't like alerting visitors for no reason)
    </ul>
