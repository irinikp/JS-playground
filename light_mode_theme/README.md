  	<h1>Adjust CSS Theme according to daylight</h1>
  	<p>
  	   Writting handlers to change the theme of every single element through DOM seems like too much of a trouble, I prefer this simple adjustment. File <a href="https://github.com/irinikp/JS-playground/blob/master/light_mode_theme/daynight_theme.js">daynight_theme.js</a> is the script I use on my personal website.

    <h3>TODO: </h3>
  	<ul>
    <li>Adjust according to month (winter is darker sooner than summer)
    <li>Adjust according to location (although I am not planning to apply it on my website, since I don't like alerting visitors for no reason by trying to access their location)
    </ul>
